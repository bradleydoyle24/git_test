    <h3>Steps for Scrubbing a Left Heart Cath</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Needle puncture as Dr. palpates radial pulse. Sometimes ultrasound is used for this step.</li>
        <li>A short 0<strong>.035" J-Wire</strong> will be inserted through the needle into the radial artery.</li>
        <li>Needle is removed, <strong>6 fr Nitinol Sheath</strong> is slid over the wire and into the radial artery.</li>
        <li>A <strong>0.035" x 150cm J-Wire</strong> is inserted into a <strong>100 cm Radial Tig</strong> catheter until the J-Wire is at the end of the catheter.</li>
        <li>The catheter is inserted into the radial artery through the sheath, and progressed up the radial artery, around the <strong>aortic arch</strong>. Pin the wire so the catheter can be advanced.</li>
        <li>The Dr. will select the <em>Left and Right Coronary Arteries</em>. Inject dye as the Dr moves the x-ray tube around to get different views of the arteries.</li>
        <li>When finished, the Dr will remove the catheter over a wire, remove the sheath, and put on a <strong>TR Band</strong> to stop the patient from bleeding.</li>
