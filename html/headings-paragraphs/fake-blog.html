    <h1>Here Is The Title of Something Really Important!</h1>

    <h2>A little more about this important thing...</h2>

    <p>Here is some <em>random</em> text about something <strong>super important.</strong> You can tell what I'm talking about has some exciting points because I <em>italicize</em> and  <strong>embolden</strong> the words.</p>

    <p>How about I elaborate on the topic? Man, today was <em>such</em> an exciting day.  The things I do have <strong>meaning</strong> and <strong>purpose</strong>. I am so glad I started a Blog to write about it to <strong><em>absolutely everybody!!!</em></strong></p>

    <h1>How about another topic?</h1>
    <h2>Yes, there is yet another...</h2>

    <p><em>Boy howdy,</em> is there a wild amount of incredible things to discuss today! I am purely blown away by the amount of lovely things that permeate through my <em>entire being</em>.</p>
    
    <!--Headings mid-paragraph will create a new paragraph for the heading, and another new paragraph afterward.-->
    <p><strong>Surely</strong>, there is more that can be done with these <em>simple tools?</em> I mean, besides this basic structure, what happens if I do this: <h3>How about a heading mid paragraph, hmm?</h3> Maybe that will look <strong><em>wild and crazy!</em></strong></p>
    
    <h3>Looks like the h1 heading is too large for each topic.</h3>
    <h4>Perhaps h3 followed by h4 will be better...</h4>
    <p>Yes, here we go with <em>another</em> go at some blog-type setups. I hope this one looks better! <em>What?? It does??</em>  <strong>Fantastic!!!</strong></p>
